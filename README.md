## Overview
Tcc-Front is a web-based dashboard built with Next.js 15.1.6, React 19, and TypeScript. It provides tools for managing users, competitions, exercises, rankings, and more, with real-time updates via SignalR WebSocket. The application features a modern and responsive UI using Material-UI v7 and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- **User authentication and role-based access** (Admin, Teacher, Student roles)
- **Competition and exercise management** with template support
- **Real-time updates via SignalR WebSocket** for submissions, questions, and ranking
- **Live ranking and results visualization** with instant updates
- **Admin and participant dashboards** with role-specific features
- **Q&A system** for real-time question/answer during competitions
- **Submission management** with automatic judging and manual correction
- **Responsive design** with Material-UI v7 and Tailwind CSS
- **Server-side rendering** with Next.js App Router

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v18 or higher (v22.18.0 used in Docker)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **SSL Certificates** for local HTTPS development (in `certificates/` folder)
- (Optional) **Docker** for containerized deployment

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabipataca/Tcc-Front.git
   cd Tcc-Front
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.development` or `.env.production` and adjust as needed
   - Required variables:
     - `PRIVATE_API_URL`: Backend API URL for server-side requests (e.g., `https://localhost:7163/api`)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL_CUSTOM`: WebSocket hub URL (e.g., `https://localhost:7163`)
     - `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`: For development with self-signed certificates

4. Generate SSL certificates for local HTTPS:
   - Place `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` in the `certificates/` folder
   - Or generate using tools like `mkcert` or `openssl`

## Running the Project

### Development Mode
Start the development server with HTTPS (required for SignalR WebSocket):
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at **https://localhost:3000**.

> **Important:** 
> - The project runs with `--experimental-https` flag for local HTTPS support
> - Ensure `certificates/localhost.pem` and `certificates/localhost-key.pem` exist
> - Trust the certificates in your browser if prompted
> - Backend API must be running and accessible at the configured `PRIVATE_API_URL`

### Docker Deployment
Build and run using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t tcc-front .
docker run -p 3000:3000 tcc-front
```

## Building for Production
Build the optimized production bundle:
```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

The production build will:
- Optimize and minify all assets
- Generate static pages where possible (ISR/SSG)
- Enable production optimizations for React and Next.js

## Testing and Linting

### Linting
Run ESLint to check code quality:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Testing
Currently, no automated test suite is configured. Consider adding:
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing
