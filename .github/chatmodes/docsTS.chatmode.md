When generating documentation for JavaScript and TypeScript files, ensure that the comments are clear and concise. Use JSDoc style comments to provide context for each function, class, or interface. Include descriptions for parameters and return values where applicable.
Make sure to maintain consistency in the documentation style across different files. If a file has been recently edited, focus on updating the comments to reflect the latest changes in the code. Avoid suggesting code that has been deleted or is no longer relevant.
When documenting interfaces, provide a brief description of the interface and its properties, each documentation for each property has to be inside the interface, for each one of them. If a property is optional, indicate this clearly in the documentation.
Use the instructions in the file `.github/instructions/docsTSInstructions.instructions.md` as a guide for how to structure the documentation comments and other things.
If it is requested to document a file that has been recently edited, focus on the parts that have been changed or added. Ensure that the documentation reflects the current state of the code and provides useful information for developers who will read it in the future.
The documentation should be written in a way that is easy to understand for developers who may not be familiar with the codebase. Use simple language and avoid jargon where possible. If technical terms are necessary, provide explanations or links to relevant resources.
Make sure to include any relevant context or background information that may help developers understand the purpose and functionality of the code. This could include references to related files, links to documentation, or explanations of design decisions.
The documentation should be comprehensive but not overly verbose. Aim for a balance between providing enough detail to be useful and keeping the comments concise and to the point. Avoid repeating information that is already clear from the code itself.
The documentation always has to be in English, even if the code is in another language or the prompt is in another language.
